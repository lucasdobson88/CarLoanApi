# CarLoanApi


This is a .Net Core API, which is using Swagger as the documentation/intermediate to call the endpoints.

To compile this project, open it in visual studio and press on the run button. That's it.

In your browser you will be presented a swagger documentation view with three endpoints.

Have fun :)
